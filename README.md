# CPP Maze Runner
HW for my Programming Methodologies Course

# About
This program is a console application that solves a maze, a 2d array of characters, by starting at 
one point and moving to the first empty point it finds, pushing its previous point to a stack. 
When it comes to a dead end, the stack will start popping until it can move to an empty space. 
If stack is empty, but there are no empty spaces found and the program is not at the end of the maze, 
then the maze is deemed unsolvable.
